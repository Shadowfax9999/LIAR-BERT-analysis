# LIAR-BERT-analysis
This code is intended to use a BERT tokenizer to try and predict how false statements in the LIAR dataset are. This is one of my first attempts at NLP, and is supposed to be a learning exercise to try and understand how transformers learn. As such the code may not be the best way of doing anything, but one cannot make an omelette without breaking some eggs.
